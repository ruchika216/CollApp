# Enhanced Task Management System

This document explains the enhanced Task Management System implemented in CollApp.

## Overview

The Task Management System is designed to help manage tasks efficiently with role-based access controls. There are two main roles:

1. **Admin** - Can create, update, delete tasks, and assign them to developers
2. **Developer** - Can view assigned tasks, update task status, and add comments

## Components

### 1. TaskListScreenNew

This screen displays a list of all tasks with filtering capabilities:

- Header with task count
- Search functionality
- Status filters (To Do, In Progress, Review, Testing, Completed)
- Priority filters (High, Medium, Low)
- Task cards with detailed information

**Role-based features:**

- Admins: Can see all tasks and have a "Create Task" button
- Developers: Can see only assigned tasks

### 2. CreateTaskModalNew

This modal allows admins to create new tasks with the following fields:

- Title
- Description
- Status selection
- Priority selection
- Due date picker
- Assignee selection (multiple developers can be assigned)

**Role-based features:**

- Only accessible to admins

### 3. TaskDetailScreenNew

This screen displays detailed information about a task and allows updates:

- Task title and description
- Status and priority indicators with ability to change
- Progress bar based on status
- Due date display and selection
- Assignee management
- Comments section for collaboration

**Role-based features:**

- Admins: Can edit all task details and delete tasks
- Developers: Can update status and add comments for assigned tasks

## State Management

The system uses Redux for state management with enhanced functionality:

### Enhanced Task Slice

`enhancedTaskSlice.ts` provides the following features:

- Filtering tasks by status, priority, search term, and assignees
- Creating, updating, and deleting tasks
- Task summary statistics
- Real-time updates using Firebase subscriptions

### Enhanced Task Services

`enhancedTaskServices.ts` provides the following services:

- Get tasks with filters
- Get task summary statistics
- Subscribe to task updates with filters
- Get task statistics for specific time periods

## How to Use

### For Admins:

1. **View Tasks:**

   - Go to the Task List screen to see all tasks
   - Use filters to narrow down tasks by status, priority, or search term

2. **Create a Task:**

   - Click the "+" button on the Task List screen
   - Fill in all required fields in the Create Task modal
   - Assign to one or more developers
   - Set priority and status
   - Save the task

3. **Edit a Task:**

   - Select a task to view details
   - Click the Edit button to make changes
   - Update any field as needed
   - Save changes

4. **Delete a Task:**
   - Open a task's details
   - Click the Delete button
   - Confirm deletion

### For Developers:

1. **View Assigned Tasks:**

   - Go to the Task List screen to see tasks assigned to you
   - Use filters to narrow down tasks by status, priority, or search term

2. **Update Task Status:**

   - Select a task to view details
   - Click the Edit button
   - Update the status as you progress
   - Save changes

3. **Add Comments:**
   - Open a task's details
   - Scroll to the Comments section
   - Add a comment to provide updates or ask questions

## Implementation Details

- **Firebase Integration:** Tasks are stored in Firestore with real-time updates
- **TypeScript:** All components and services use TypeScript for type safety
- **Responsive Design:** UI adapts to different screen sizes
- **Theme Support:** Components use the app's theme for consistent styling

## Best Practices

1. Always update task status as work progresses
2. Use comments to communicate important information
3. Set realistic due dates for tasks
4. Use appropriate priority levels based on business impact
5. Keep task descriptions clear and concise

## Future Enhancements

- Task dependencies
- File attachments
- Time tracking
- Subtasks
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Email notifications for task updates
