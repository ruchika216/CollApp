# Developer Access for Projects Update

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Firestore Rules**:

   - Fixed syntax error in project update rules
   - Removed the extra parenthesis causing syntax error
   - Confirmed that developers can update any projects they're assigned to

2. **Removed Client-Side Field Filtering**:

   - Modified `firestoreService.ts` to remove role-based field filtering
   - Developers can now update all project fields except immutable ones (`id`, `createdAt`, `createdBy`)
   - Removed unnecessary `developerAllowed` field list since it's no longer needed

3. **Improved Project Assignment Sync**:
   - Modified the project-user sync logic to work for all users (not just admins)
   - Developers can now update project assignments and the system will sync properly

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Log in as a developer user
2. Navigate to a project you're assigned to
3. Make updates to any field (title, description, status, etc.)
4. Changes should save without permission errors
5. Project-user relationships should sync correctly

## Technical Notes

- The permission system now relies entirely on Firestore rules for access control
- Client-side filtering was causing inconsistent behavior where the UI might allow changes that the server rejected
- This approach is more maintainable and follows the "single source of truth" principle for permissions

If you encounter any issues, please check:

1. That your developer account is properly assigned to the project
2. The Firebase console logs for any rule evaluation errors
3. The client app logs for any API errors
